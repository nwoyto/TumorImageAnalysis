# TumorImageAnalysis
## Work in progress,
### Model looks good.

## To Do List:

Why is the VGG16 model not performing well despite evidence elsewhere of it working with this dataset.

Need Powerpoint to explain workflow and results. 

Web Application: User uploads image of brain mri as .jpg ---> site preprocesses image and feeds it to the model ---> applicaition indicates whethere it is or is not a brain tumor with a metric of % certainty.

Clean up --> better captions and mark down.
